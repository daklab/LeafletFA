# LeafletFA - A probabilistic factor model for learning RNA splicing-driven cell states in single-cell RNA-seq data
LeafletFA leverages probabilistic Bayesian inference to identify alternative splicing patterns that define distinct cellular states in large-scale single-cell datasets. The model uniquely learns cell-specific splicing states without relying on predefined splicing events or cell-type labels, making it ideal for exploring complex splicing dynamics.

### Model overview 
The figure below provides a visual summary of the LeafletFA model and its input data structure:
